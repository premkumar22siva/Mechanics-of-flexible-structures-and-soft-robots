The code is written in Python.
The Helper functions for the code are taken from the course notes of Prof. M. Khalid Jawed from his lectures for the course: Mechanics of flexible structures and soft robots.

Download the code and run it on any Python development environment you choose.

**Problem 1**
-
There is no user input needed to run this code. Just running the program is enough. Once the program is run, the results should show the rod's configuration with time and the tip deflection in terms of the z-coordinate of the last node with time.

The pseudocode, case setup, and the inferences drawn from the results are summarized in detail in the final report named "Homework2_Sivakumar".
