# MAE 263F - Homework 3
The code is written in Python.
The functions for the code are taken from the course notes of Prof. M. Khalid Jawed from his lectures for the course: Mechanics of flexible structures and soft robots.

Download the code and run it on any Python development environment you choose.

**Problem 1**
-
There is no user input needed to run this code. Just running the program is enough. Once the program is run, the results should show the linear fit to the generated data and also the sensitivity of the model to the hyperparameters.

The model, results and the inferences drawn from the results are summarized in detail in the final report named "Homework3_Sivakumar".

**Problem 2**

There is no user input needed to run this code. Just running the program is enough. Once the program is run, the results should show the non-linear fit to the generated data and also the sensitivity of the model to the hyperparameters.

The model, results and the inferences drawn from the results are summarized in detail in the final report named "Homework3_Sivakumar".
