# Mechanics-of-flexible-structures-and-soft-robots
This repository is created to store the source codes and reports of the discrete simulations run for flexible structures.

The source code and report for Assignment 1 can be found inside the folder named 'Homework 1'. 

The code for the three questions is written in Python.

Download the code and run it on any of the following platforms:
  1. Local Development Environment (on your computer)
