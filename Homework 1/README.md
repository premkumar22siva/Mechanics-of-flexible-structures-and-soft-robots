# MAE 263F - Homework 1
The code for the three questions is written in Python.
The Helper functions for the code are taken from the course notes of Prof. M. Khalid Jawed from his lectures for the course: Mechanics of flexible structures and soft robots.

Download the code and run it on any of the following platforms:
  1. Local Development Environment (on your computer)
     - Python Interpreters like Command Prompt or PowerShell (if Windows) or the Terminal (if Mac/Linux)
     - IDEs (Integrated Development Environments):
       - PyCharm
       - Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
       - Spyder
       - Jupyter Notebook
  2. Online Python Interpreters/IDEs

**Problem 1**
-
On running Problem1.py, the user will be asked to enter I or E to choose between the  Implicit and Explicit methods to solve. Press I or i for the implicit method and press E or e for the explicit method.
The explicit method would take some time to converge due to the smaller time step.

Once the program is run, there should be five plots displayed in the following order:
  - Simulation of the motion of the structure
  - Shape of the structure at time t = 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 s
  - Position of Sphere 2 with respect to time
  - Velocity of Sphere 2 with respect to time
  - Turning angle at the middle node with respect to time

The case setup and the inferences drawn from the results are summarized in detail in the final report named "Homework1_Sivakumar". 

**Problem 2**
-
There is no user input needed to run this code. Just running the program is enough. Once the program is run, there should be seven plots displayed in the following order:
  - Simulation of the motion of the structure
  - Final shape of the structure
  - Position of the middle node with time
  - Velocity of the middle node with time
  - Turning angle at the middle node with time
  - Sensitivity of terminal velocity to time step size (dt)
  - Sensitivity of terminal velocity to number of nodes (N)

The case setup and the inferences drawn from the results are summarized in detail in the final report named "Homework1_Sivakumar".

**Problem 3**
-
There is no user input needed to run this code. Just running the program is enough. Once the program is run, there should be seven plots displayed in the following order:
  - Simulation of the deformation of the beam
  - Maximum vertical displacement with respect to time from the simulation and from beam theory
  - Comparison of the maximum deflection from the solver and the predictions from beam theory for different values of external force

The case setup and the inferences drawn from the results are summarized in detail in the final report named "Homework1_Sivakumar".
