# MAE 263F - Final Project
The code is written in Python.
The Helper functions for the code are taken from the course notes of Prof. M. Khalid Jawed from his lectures for the course: Mechanics of flexible structures and soft robots.

There are two source codes in this folder:
- One with variable stiffness and no contact forces
- The other with contact forces but constant stiffness

By default both the source codes use the material properties of Elastosil. You can switch to the material properties of Soft Translucent silicone by changing the value of elastic modulus as mentioned in the comments under the Main().

Download the code and run it on any Python development environment you choose.

**Source code with variable stiffness**
-
No user input is needed to run this code. Just running the program is enough. Once the program is run, the results should show the actuators' initial configuration, actuators' position with time, animation of the gripper, animation of the gripper underwater, timeline of the actuation and the tip deflection in terms of the z-coordinate of the last node with time.

**Source code with contact forces**
-
No user input is needed to run this code. Just running the program is enough. Once the program is run, the results should show the object to be grasped along with the actuators' initial configuration, actuators' position with time, animation of the gripper, animation of the gripper underwater, timeline of the actuation and the tip deflection in terms of the z-coordinate of the last node with time.


The background of the project, model setup, observations and the inferences drawn from the results are summarized in detail in the final report named "FinalReport".
